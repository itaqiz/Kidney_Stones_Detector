## Objective
üè• Enhance diagnostic capabilities and reduce false negatives in kidney stone detection using machine learning and deep learning models.

## Implementation Details

### Data Processing
- **Dataset Acquisition**: Medical imaging data such as CT scans and ultrasounds.
- **Preprocessing**: Convert images to grayscale, normalize pixel values, and augment the dataset to improve model robustness.
- **Segmentation**: Focus on the kidney region to isolate potential areas of interest.

### Model Training
- **Model Architecture**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for medical image classification.
- **Training**: Using labeled datasets to train the model on recognizing patterns indicative of kidney stones.
- **Optimization**: Fine-tune hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size to achieve optimal results.

### Evaluation
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
- **Validation**: Use a validation dataset to prevent overfitting.
- **Testing**: Test the model on unseen data to ensure real-world applicability.
